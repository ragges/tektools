
tdsNvramEepromFloppyDumper:

A modified version of the dump scripts that dumps both the NVRAM and
EEPROM in one sweep.

NOTE - only works on the 5xx/6xx/7xx models -B, -C and -D series
scopes, starting with firmware v4.x.

Puts interactive messages on screen.  Dumps the nvram to a file called
nvram.bin, and the acquistion calibration eeproms to a file called
acqeeprm.bin.
This script uses an intermediate buffer and takes a fast snapshot of
the NVRAM, so other processes cannot interfere with the procedure
while writing to disk.
The original is reported to work only on more recent scopes and
firmwares such as the -C and -D series.
