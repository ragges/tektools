Extra files required to build a DOS .exe.

**GPIB driver
DECL.H, MCIB.LIB: from NI 2.7.2 driver for DOS; they provide a .LIB file in Microsof C format.

**getopt
tekfwtool needs libgetopt; easy to compile.
source used:
https://www.flashrom.org/File:Libgetopt.tar.gz

**djgpp :
There's apparently no way to convert MCIB.LIB to a format understood by djgpp-gcc,
partly due to memory model issues

** MSC
-compiling the whole thing with MS C (say v5)
-solves the NI driver lib issue.
-sizeof(size_t) == sizeof(unsigned int) !! code assumes 32bit int, anticipate problems
-MSC5 make.exe v4 sucks
-MSC6 nmake is different, but sucks also
-lots of tweaks needed for 8.3 filenames and other garbage
-MSC looks for its own "SLIBCE.LIB" ? wtf. Give it slibc7.lib
